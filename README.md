## Using with Claude Artifacts

1. Get a React artifact from Claude (example prompts):
   - "Create a counter component with increment/decrement buttons"
   - "Make a temperature converter with Celsius and Fahrenheit"
   - "Build a todo list with local storage"

2. Copy the entire artifact code (including imports) and replace the contents of `src/app/page.tsx` with it.

3. The artifact should work immediately since all required dependencies and configurations are pre-installed!
